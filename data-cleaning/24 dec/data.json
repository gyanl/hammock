Uniting the voices of dozens of witnesses to the collapse of the USSR in a formidable attempt to chart the disappearance of a culture, combining extended individual monologues with a collage of voices, Alexievich creates a magnificent requiem to a civilization in ruins, a brilliant, poignant and unique portrait of the terrors and solaces of post-Soviet society."

The novel follows the experience of an ageing college professor, George, crushed and depressed after losing his partner in a car accident, quietly planning his suicide while life gets in the way. While Tom Ford’s 2009 adaptation conveys the styles and anxieties of the novel, nothing quite matches the beautiful tone of despondency created by Isherwood."

The ruthlessness of growing up poor and the limits of love are laid bare as his mother drinks herself to death after her husband deserts her, leaving her with three children in an impoverished mining town. At the centre of all this, little Shuggie is just beginning to perceive, and trying to puzzle out why nearly everyone he meets considers him “no right.” Filled with lyrical Scottish slang, visceral descriptions of bodies and the understanding of growing up with an alcoholic parent, Shuggie Bain is one of the most explosive debuts of modern times."

It offers a vivid window into the hedonistic world of 20th century Paris."

Shame is one of the centrepieces of the novel, that recounts an anguished love affair in Paris between the American narrator David, and Giovanni, an Italian bartender. The entire novel dissects shame, its roots, the myths that perpetuate it, the harm it can do, and its arbitrariness. While David sees shame as a natural conclusion to queerness, the novel also offers Giovanni, who seems immune to it. It’s this freedom that Giovanni represents that makes him such an iconic character."

The fact that this pitch-perfect premise was devised years before the pandemic is testament to the novel’s incisive originality."
